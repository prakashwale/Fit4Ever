# Fit4Ever Project - Comprehensive Interview Preparation Guide

## üèóÔ∏è **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

### **Q: Can you give me an overview of the Fit4Ever project?**

**A:** Fit4Ever is a comprehensive fitness management web application built with Spring Boot 3.5.5 and Java 17. It's a full-stack application that helps users track their fitness journey through multiple modules:

- **Workout Tracking**: Log exercises, sets, reps, and weights with detailed workout history
- **Nutrition Management**: Track calories, macros, and meals with daily nutrition summaries  
- **Goal Setting**: Set SMART fitness goals (weight, workouts per week, calories) and track progress
- **User Authentication**: Secure JWT-based authentication with role management
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize progress with comprehensive charts and statistics

The application follows a modern architecture with a Spring Boot REST API backend and a responsive vanilla JavaScript frontend. It supports multiple deployment strategies including AWS with Docker containerization, Railway platform, and local development with PostgreSQL in production and H2 for development.

## üèõÔ∏è **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Q: What is the overall architecture of your application?**

**A:** The application follows a layered architecture pattern:

1. **Presentation Layer**: RESTful controllers (`@RestController`) handling HTTP requests
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic implementation with `@Service` annotations  
3. **Repository Layer**: Data access using Spring Data JPA repositories
4. **Model Layer**: JPA entities representing the domain model
5. **Configuration Layer**: Security, CORS, JWT, and OpenAPI configuration

**Key architectural decisions:**
- **Stateless Design**: JWT-based authentication for scalability
- **Database Abstraction**: Spring Data JPA for database independence
- **Profile-based Configuration**: Separate configurations for development (H2) and production (PostgreSQL)
- **DTO Pattern**: Separate DTOs for API contracts to decouple internal models

### **Q: How did you structure your codebase? Walk me through the package organization.**

**A:** The codebase follows Spring Boot conventions with clear separation of concerns:

```
com.example.fit4ever/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/          # Security, JWT, CORS, OpenAPI configurations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controller/      # REST controllers (Auth, User, Workout, Nutrition, Goal)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dto/            # Data Transfer Objects for API contracts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exception/      # Global exception handling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model/          # JPA entities (User, Workout, Exercise, FoodLog, Goal)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repository/     # Spring Data JPA repositories
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ service/        # Business logic layer
```

Each package has a single responsibility, making the code maintainable and testable.

## üîê **SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Q: How did you implement authentication and authorization in your application?**

**A:** I implemented a comprehensive JWT-based security system:

**Authentication Flow:**
1. **Registration/Login**: User credentials are validated, password is hashed with BCrypt
2. **JWT Generation**: Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is generated with 1-hour expiration
3. **Token Storage**: Frontend stores JWT in localStorage and includes it in Authorization headers
4. **Request Filtering**: `JwtAuthFilter` intercepts requests, validates tokens, and sets SecurityContext

**Key Security Components:**
- **SecurityConfig**: Configures Spring Security with stateless session management
- **JwtUtil**: Handles token generation, validation, and email extraction
- **CustomUserDetailsService**: Loads user details for authentication
- **Password Encoding**: BCrypt with Spring Security's PasswordEncoder

**Security Features:**
- CSRF disabled (stateless JWT)
- CORS configured for cross-origin requests
- Whitelist for public endpoints (auth, static files, Swagger)
- Role-based access control (USER role)

### **Q: How do you handle CORS and what security measures did you implement?**

**A:** CORS is handled through `CorsConfig`:
- Allows specific origins, methods, and headers
- Credentials support for authenticated requests
- Different configurations for development and production environments

**Additional Security Measures:**
- JWT secret key (should be externalized in production)
- Input validation with Bean Validation annotations
- User-specific data access (users can only access their own data)
- Exception handling to prevent information leakage

## üóÑÔ∏è **DATABASE DESIGN & JPA**

### **Q: Tell me about your database design and entity relationships.**

**A:** I designed a normalized database schema with clear entity relationships:

**Core Entities:**
1. **User**: Base entity with authentication details
2. **Workout**: Contains workout metadata (title, date, notes)
3. **Exercise**: Detailed exercise data within workouts
4. **FoodLog**: Nutrition tracking with meal types and macros
5. **Goal**: User goals with types (WEIGHT, WORKOUTS_PER_WEEK, CALORIES)

**Relationships:**
- **User ‚Üî Workout**: One-to-Many (user can have multiple workouts)
- **Workout ‚Üî Exercise**: One-to-Many with cascade operations
- **User ‚Üî FoodLog**: One-to-Many with indexed queries
- **User ‚Üî Goal**: One-to-Many for goal tracking

**JPA Features Used:**
- `@GeneratedValue` for auto-incrementing IDs
- `@ManyToOne` with proper fetch strategies (LAZY for performance)
- `@OneToMany` with cascade operations and orphan removal
- Custom indexes for query optimization
- Bean Validation for data integrity

### **Q: How did you handle database configuration for different environments?**

**A:** I implemented profile-based database configuration:

**Development (default profile):**
- H2 in-memory database for fast testing
- H2 console enabled at `/h2-console`
- DDL auto-update for schema changes
- SQL logging enabled for debugging

**Production (`application-prod.yml`):**
- PostgreSQL with connection pooling (HikariCP)
- Environment variable-based database URL
- Optimized connection pool settings
- SQL logging disabled for performance

**Benefits:**
- Easy local development without setup
- Production-ready with minimal configuration changes
- Environment variable injection for secure deployment

3. **Route Protection**: UI elements shown/hidden based on authentication
4. **Session Management**: Token validation and automatic logout on expiry
5. **User Experience**: Seamless switching between authenticated and guest views
